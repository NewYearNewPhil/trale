<h3><b>Disclaimer</b></h3>
Even though the app provides workouts for all fitness levels, it aims only for advanced athletes, knowing exercises and how to execute them correctly.
This is crucial, since the incorrect execution of exercises can cause irreversible damage.

This app is still in <b>alpha</b> stage and may contain bugs. It should work best with FHD/FHD+ resolution. 
If you encounter a bug or if you are missing a feature, please <a href="https://gitlab.com/mobilemovement/adonify/-/issues">open a new issue</a>.
